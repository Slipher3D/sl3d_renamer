# sl3d_renamer

This is an addon for Blender 2.8 that streamlines multi-object renaming/appending.

You can rename all the selected objects and add seperate pre/suffix to the objects. This tool was created with baking Substance Painter maps in mind. One can very quickly add _low and _high to meshes for name-matching bakes.
